# Bachelor Thesis

This repository contains the code of a browser based learning environment for primary school children. The exercises are strongly based on an already existing textbook written by experts. For this project, ChatGPT was utilized primarily for debugging and troubleshooting. Any code that was entirely generated by AI is explicitly marked with comments.
